### Project Description

omime_sniff is a CLI image MIME type sniffer

## What is a MIME type?

MIME stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions.
MIME types form a standard way of classifying types in the Internet and each of them
has a type and subtype ie. image/jpeg!

## Common Case

Checking mime types is a good way to ensure that your users are not renaming their scripting files and uploading them to your server! Unfortunately these can be easily bypassed by renaming the file extension. 

That's where MIME sniffing comes into play :)
